romanType Class
You should also write private helper functions to convert from a int to a roman numeral, and from a string roman numeral to a int. (seen at bottom of class diagram)

Testing: Write a program that uses this class and all methods. You can assume that the input for Roman numeral is a legal string. Your test program should allow the user to enter/test more Roman numerals than the ones given in the text.
